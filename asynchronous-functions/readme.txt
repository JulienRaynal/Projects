Webpage I made to get the weather and the top attractions in the cities using FOURSQUARE and OPENWEATHER API.
This project uses asynchronous functions to work smoothly.
I did not make the css, the Page Element and the HTML functions in the js.

This was all an exercice I had to do on codecademy.com
